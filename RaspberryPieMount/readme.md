# Raspberry pi 3 mount with some added Perlin noise 

The RaspberryMount model is meant to be mounted using screws and the RaspberryDeskMount is measured to fit my table (25mm) as a push to fit piece. Both models use mounting holes that fit M2.5 screws for the Raspberry, the screw holes slightly larger on the actual Mount. 

Perlin noise data was generated using a program created by volzotan, [perlin noise generator](https://github.com/volzotan/tlpic/tree/master/generate)

Printed from PETG since I have that on hand. Printed at 0.20 layer height, no supports required when printed on the side that doesn't have the sd card slot.
